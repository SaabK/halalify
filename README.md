# Halalify - Spotify Clone

Who wants to listen to music, when you have Quran.

# Things I learned so far:

-   Better to use {children} way for passing server components inside of client components.
-   React Icons Library is awesome for icons
-   Forward Refs are used to use ref of a child element in a parent component. Useful!
